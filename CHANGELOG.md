# Changelog

Nexora Commerce has a single product line on the `main` branch. Only release-level changes are listed.

## 3.7.0 — 2026-09-29

Schema 51, Extension API 2.0, production channel.

### Added
- One design-token layer (`assets/shared/tokens.css`) for admin and storefront: spacing, type scale, control heights (32/40/48), radius, elevation, z-index layers, icon sizes and a fixed breakpoint set. Density in Appearance now really rescales controls and spacing.
- Lucide is the only icon set: icons are generated from the installed `@lucide/vue` package (`tools/build-lucide-icons.mjs` → `resources/icons/lucide.json`) and rendered by `ui_icon()` / `lucideIcon()`.
- Release gates: `icons-check` (only real Lucide icons, no inline SVG), `css-coverage-check` (every template class has a style), `design-tokens-check` (no raw font sizes, z-indexes, radii, shadows or breakpoints).
- Demo catalog grows to 29 products in 5 categories (DummyJSON, MIT); demo counts on the home page are computed from real data.

### Changed
- Admin and storefront CSS rewritten from scratch on the tokens (one button, form, table, card, badge, modal and notice system). Admin gets a grouped sidebar with icons, breadcrumbs, a working dashboard action center, icon row actions and consistent list toolbars.
- Storefront: compact non-blocking cookie card, rebuilt hero, product-on-tone promo banners, uniform product cards, adaptive category tiles, text-first article cards.
- Storefront font is chosen in Appearance: System UI, Inter Variable or Manrope (self-hosted).
- New stores ship without promotional artwork; hero and banners appear after they are configured.
- Vite `base` is `/build/`, so chunk preloads no longer 404.

### Fixed
- Home page tiles and banners linked to categories that did not exist (`/kids`, `/beauty-health`, …); they are now built from real categories.
- Forum search returned 500 (invalid `ESCAPE` clause).
- Product page showed the raw unit code (`item`) next to the quantity.
- About 70 admin and 55 storefront CSS classes used in templates had no styles; Bootstrap-style leftovers removed.

## 3.6.6 — 2026-09-29

Schema 51, Extension API 2.0, production channel.

### Added
- Store-scoped customer membership and customer groups; customers are bound to the store on registration, cart binding and checkout.
- Store scope carried through the integration, Google and marketing job queues, delivery records and diagnostics/retry.
- Real-runtime E2E: admin catalog CRUD against the storefront, category merchandising, Media Library lifecycle, read-only RBAC with a limited admin, cron execution state, route sweep of every admin/storefront route.
- CI workflows: quality gate, QA, database runtime matrix (MySQL 8.4, MariaDB 10.11 / 11.4), production certification, release package build.
- Self-hosted Inter and Manrope fonts (no third-party font requests; compatible with the CSP).

### Changed
- Site capability guard is a single storefront subscriber; the admin runtime uses server-defined capability profiles.
- Release metadata, version and schema are derived from the platform version and validated by `release-contract-check`.
- `main` is the only canonical branch; `vendor/`, compiled assets and `SHA256SUMS.txt` are build artifacts and are no longer stored in git.
- Documentation consolidated: versioned capability matrices, QA notes and README sections replaced by one current copy.

### Fixed
- Installer and UI showed raw translation keys: 45 missing uk-UA/en-US keys added (installer errors and success screen, SEO descriptions, scheduler labels, checkout price error).
- Hardcoded exception literals and template strings ("OK", "Email") moved to translation catalogs.
- Schema 51 store-scope migration made atomic; media table collation pinned across MySQL and MariaDB.
- Read-only RBAC gaps for Universal Import, multilingual export, SEO redirect manager and Nova Poshta actions.
- Stale release-gate checks (demo showcase, multistore isolation, install/upgrade safety, localization) aligned with the current implementation.
- SQL accidentally extracted into a translation catalog removed, with a regression gate; DOM-sink XSS hardening in storefront updates and appearance presets.
- Unsafe defaults: reverse-proxy trust is explicit (`SYMFONY_TRUSTED_PROXIES`); fresh uninstalled storefront redirects to `/setup.php`.
